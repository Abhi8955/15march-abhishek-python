What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed? 
When the expression `"1" == 1` is executed in Python, it will evaluate to `False`. 
This is because the operands on either side of the `==` operator are of different types: `"1"` is a string literal, 
and `1` is an integer literal.

In Python, the `==` operator is used for equality comparison.
When comparing values of different types, Python will consider the values to be unequal, regardless of their actual content.

In this case, the string `"1"` is not equal to the integer `1` because they are different types. 
The string `"1"` represents a sequence of characters, while the integer `1` represents a numerical value. 
Therefore, the expression `"1" == 1` will evaluate to `False`.

It's important to note the distinction between different types in Python and be mindful of their equality comparisons. 
If you want to compare values of different types, you may need to convert them to a common type before performing the comparison.
